Now that we have verified that Docker is working and that we can run some basic commands lets start building an image.

<br>

* Create a new directory, this is where all container related files will reside.

```plain
mkdir ~/containers101
```{{exec}}

* Navigate to the newly created directory

```plain
cd ~/containers101
```{{exec}}

* Copy  the 'Dockerfile' located in the high level home directory to the containers101 sub directory

```plain
cp ~/Dockerfile ~/containers101/
```{{exec}}

* Evaluate the contents of the Dockerfile 

```plain
cat ~/containers101/Dockerfile
```{{exec}}

* You will notice the Dockerfile requires an additional file called 'index.html', copy this file to the same directory as the newly copied Dockerfile. This file is only related to the web server, the contents are not too relevant for this tutorial.

```plain
cp ~/index.html ~/containers101/
```{{exec}}

* Now that we have the necessary files, lets create a container image, tag the image 'my-nginx-image:1.0.0'. *Do not forget the dot at the end of the command* , this indicates to the container engine that the Dockerfile is in the current directory.

```plain
docker build -t my-nginx-image:1.0.0 .
```{{exec}}

>Tagging an image is optional, 'docker build .' would suffice to build an image. If no tag is provided a random id is generated by the container engine, however for reference and tracking purposes it is much easier to add meaningful tags

* Lets see if the image exists

```plain
docker images
```{{exec}}

* The output of the above should return two images, one will relate to the FROM line in the Dockerfile and the other will be your custom image.
