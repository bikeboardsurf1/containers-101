STEP2

>Now that we have verified that Docker is working and that we can run some basic commands lets start building an image.

<br>

* Navigate to the working directory for that contains the exercises
```plain
cd /root/containers101 
```{{exec}}


* List the contents, each folder corresponds with a step

```plain
ls 
```{{exec}}

* Navigate to step 2

```plain
cd step2
```{{exec}}


* Evaluate the contents of the Dockerfile 

```plain
cat ~/containers101/step2/Dockerfile
```{{exec}}

* You will notice the Dockerfile requires an additional file called 'index.html', copy this file to the same directory as the newly copied Dockerfile. This file is only related to the web server, the contents are not too relevant for this tutorial.

* Lets create a container image, tag the image 'my-nginx-image:1.0.0'. *Do not forget the dot at the end of the command* , this indicates to the container engine that the Dockerfile is in the current directory.

```plain
docker build -t my-nginx-image:1.0.0 .
```{{exec}}

>Tagging an image is optional, 'docker build .' would suffice to build an image. If no tag is provided a random id is generated by the container engine, however for reference and tracking purposes it is much easier to add meaningful tags. 

>If no version is applied (in this case 1.0.0), 'latest' will be applied automatically. Using latest is NOT considered best practice as it is difficult to track the actual version and 'latest' does not always map to the latest version.

* Lets see if the image exists

```plain
docker images
```{{exec}}

* The output of the above should return two images, one will relate to the FROM line in the Dockerfile and the other will be your custom image.
